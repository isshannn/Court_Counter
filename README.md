# Court_Counter
An app to record the score count of two teams in a basketball match.
 Hello Everyone this app is built as a task in a udacity corse: https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud836
 Please note the Java code for the app WAS NOT copied from the link given at the course site.
 I have added an additional undo button for call back ONLY THE LAST VALUE POINT awarded to team, i.e. to say if awarded +3 and +2 point in
 sequence the undo button will call back only +2 (the most recent call) point and not +3 points.
 
 RESET BUTTON: Clear all data entered. (includes the undo history)
